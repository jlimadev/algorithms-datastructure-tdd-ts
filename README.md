# Algorithms and Data Structure - Typescript

This is a repository where I will implement some algorithms and data structures in Typescript using TDD. The ideia is the practice over time.

For now, these are the algorithms implemented:

- FizzBuzz
- Palindrome
- Reverse String
- Reverse Integer
- Remove duplicates from string
- Most repeated character from string
